          <h2>Tuong Do, MBA</h2>
          <p>
            Tuong Do spent three decades building the thing that matters most in business: great teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            He started as an intern writing GIS code in 1996 &mdash; the most junior person on the team.
            Today, he leads global data and AI organizations that deliver nine-figure business impact.
            But the path between those two points wasn't a straight line up. It was a journey through
            fifteen different roles across startups, government, Fortune 500 companies, and his own
            ventures &mdash; wearing every hat that matters: individual contributor for 15 years,
            manager, director, VP, and founder of two companies over 19 combined years.
          </p>
          <p>
            At The Hershey Company, he scaled a 9-person data engineering team into a 27-member global
            powerhouse, leading the $23M One Hershey Data Platform initiative that broke down enterprise
            data silos and delivered over $150 million in measurable business value. Before that, he led
            AI strategy and platform development at Wells Fargo, built integrated business intelligence
            systems for the construction industry, and guided international expansion strategies for
            enterprise software companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes Tuong's perspective rare is that he's been on all three sides of the high-performing
            team equation: the individual contributor grinding through technical challenges, the manager
            translating between teams and stakeholders, and the leader architecting culture and systems
            at scale.
          </p>

        <h2>The L-M-IC Lived Experience</h2>

      <blockquote>
        "This book should be unapologetically Tuong's story &mdash; not because it's about him,
        but because his story contains the lessons readers need."
      </blockquote>
      <p style="color: var(--gray-light); margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        Unlike many business authors who consult on team dynamics from the outside, Tuong has lived the
        reality described in these pages: the 3 AM calls with Seoul, the trust-building across cultural
        divides, the crisis management when systems fail, the painful decisions about scaling, the sleepless
        nights wondering if the team will survive his eventual departure.
      </p>
      <p style="color: var(--gray-light);">
        He knows what it feels like to be the youngest person in the room with no authority, and what it
        feels like to be responsible for 27 people's careers, growth, and impact. He's failed at building
        teams, succeeded at building teams, and spent years studying why some teams catch lightning while
        others never spark at all.
